# Schemas

Community-maintained schemas for Cytoid-related JSON files

## How to use

1. Use a [compatible editor](https://json-schema.org/implementations.html#editors). Visual Studio Code is recommended.
2. Add a line to the head of your JSON file:
```json
{
    "$schema": "https://url/to/schema"
}
```
3. Enjoy the auto-completion!

- [ ] Implement JSON Schema draft 2019-09 (after Visual Studio Code fully supports it).
